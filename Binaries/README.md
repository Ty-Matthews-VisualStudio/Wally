Wally was initially created in January of 1998.  As such, it is an x86/32-bit application and no support for x64 has ever existed.  The included binary wally_155b.exe is a self-extracting zip file, created back in the 2001 timeframe.  Simply choose an output folder and unzip the contents into that folder.  The application can then be opened using Wally.exe.  For sample texture and package files, please see the [/Samples](https://github.com/Ty-Matthews-VisualStudio/Wally/tree/main/Samples) folder here on GitHub.  Alternatively, you can download SuportingFiles.zip file and extract to a location of your choice.  This zip has all but Wally.exe, in which case you can download one or both of the development versions
 
The most recent release version under development will be named Wally_xxx.exe and the most recent debug version will be named WallyD_xxx.exe.  Place either executable in the same location as Wally.exe (or wherever you installed the supporting files).  Note that the debug version will require the debug version of the MFC and Visual Studio runtime, which will only be available using the Visual Studio installer.  Both of the _xxx versions will require the supporting file structure to function properly.
