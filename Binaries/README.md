Wally was initially created in January of 1998.  As such, it is an x86/32-bit application and no support for x64 has ever existed.  The included binary here is a self-extracting zip file.  Simply choose an output folder and unzip the contents into that folder.  The application can then be opened using Wally.exe.  For sample texture and package files, please see the /Samples folder.
