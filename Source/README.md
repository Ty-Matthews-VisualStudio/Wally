This version of Wally was built using Visual Studio Community Edition 2022.  The solution and project files were regenerated from scratch and the old source files from prior environments (VC6 and VS2008) were copied over.

## Contributing

Wally welcomes contributions. When contributing, please follow the code below.

### Issues

Feel free to submit issues and enhancement requests.

Please help us by providing **minimal reproducible examples**, because source code is easier to let other people understand what happens.
For crash problems on certain platforms, please bring stack dump content with the detail of the OS, compiler, etc.

Please try breakpoint debugging first, tell us what you found, see if we can start exploring based on more information been prepared.

### Workflow

In general, we follow the "fork-and-pull" Git workflow.

 1. **Fork** the repo on GitHub
 2. **Clone** the project to your own machine
 3. **Checkout** a new branch on your fork, start developing on the branch
 4. **Test** the change before commit, Make sure the changes pass all the tests, including `unittest` and `preftest`, please add test case for each new feature or bug-fix if needed.
 5. **Commit** changes to your own branch
 6. **Push** your work back up to your fork
 7. Submit a **Pull request** so that we can review your changes

NOTE: Be sure to merge the latest from "upstream" before making a pull request!
